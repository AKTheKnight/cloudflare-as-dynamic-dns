# Cloudflare as Reverse DNS

Cloudflare is an amazing company. They provide a wide variety of services ranging from CDN, DNS, Internet protection from Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and a lot more. They have a fast DNS service which is really good in propagating changes across the Internet.

I uses Cloudflare's DNS service and with their excellent REST API, I created a BASH script to update domain record once my ISP changed my IP address.
